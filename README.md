## Overview

**Yarr** is _yet another React router_ library, but with a focus on enabling the [render-as-you-fetch concurrent UI pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html) by offering both component **code preloading** and **data preloading**. This behavior is enabled even without opt-in to [React's experimental Concurrent Mode](https://it.reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html). Yarr was originally developed for use with [Relay](https://relay.dev) (_formally Relay Modern_) in September 2020 for internal use at [Contra](https://www.contra.com).

_More info coming soon._
